# Abstractive Text Summarization using Seq2Seq model
Automatic Text Summarization is one of the most challenging topics in NLP. Abstractive
Text Summarization is the task of creating summaries that contain new sentences than
those already found in the original text, so the model needs to understand the language
itself in order to create meaningful summaries without copying sentences from the
original text.

In this project we use a seq2seq deep learning model with attention layer in the decoder to summarize long customer reviews on Amazon into short concise reviews that delivers the main point of the review in the minimum number of words. More details about the implementation, trials, and results are be found in the report.
